     <h2>About Me</h2><br>
     <p>My name is Kipleting Edwin and main hobby is watching football.I will usually start each day
          by a morning run then followed up by a heavy breakfast consisting of tea,boiled eggs and a jammed bread.
        
        After that it's six hours of coding that involves debugging and testing.A break of an hour follows,
       which involves having lunch and responding to some of the mails.On Friday,though,i replace this schedule 
       with a three hour biking around Karura Forest.
    
       I am available for any coding challenge,gigs and carrying out assignments.I offer 15% discount for more 
       than two assignments from one person.
    
       Cheers</p>
