     <h2>About Me</h2><br>
     <p>My name is Kipleting Edwin and main hobby is watching football<br>.I will usually start each day
          by a morning run then followed up by<br> a heavy breakfast consisting of tea,boiled eggs and a jammed bread.<br>
        
        After that it's six hours of coding that involves debugging and testing.<br>A break of an hour follows,
       which involves having lunch and responding<br> to some of the mails.<br><br>On Friday,though,i replace this schedule 
       with a three<br> hour biking around Karura Forest.
    
       I am available for any coding challenge,<br>gigs and carrying out assignments.I offer 15% discount for more 
       than two <br>assignments from one person.
    
       Cheers</p>
